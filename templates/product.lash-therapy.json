This deep-conditioning lash serum uses a unique blend of peptides, vegan stem cells, vitamins, and amino acids to fortify and amplify the appearance of lash length and fullness...and it can even be used on your eyebrows! When applied nightly, this proprietary formula moisturizes dry, damaged lash & brow hairs while maximizing the appearance of lash volume with each growth cycle. Expect fabulous, flutter-worthy lashes in just 60 days. This product may be used on both eyelashes and eyebrows. However, the 3 month and 6 month supply estimate is based on using Lash Therapy only on your eyelashes. Using on your eyebrows as well will mean the product will not last as long.<\/p>",
